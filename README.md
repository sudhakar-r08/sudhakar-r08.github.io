# 👋 Hi, I'm Sudhakar Raju

I'm a Senior Android Developer with over 10 years of experience building high-performance, scalable mobile and backend solutions. I specialize in Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Clean Architecture, and have hands-on experience with modern Android frameworks, IoT integrations, BLE, VoIP, and real-time communication using WebRTC and XMPP.

In addition to mobile development, I actively explore AI integration into user-facing products. I recently built [MeetMind](https://meetmind.streamlit.app/), an AI-powered meeting assistant that helps prepare meeting minutes using OpenAI APIs and Streamlit—demonstrating my interest in generative AI, LLMs, and prompt engineering.

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🔧 Architect modular Android apps using Clean Architecture and MVVM  
- 📲 Build intuitive UIs using Jetpack Compose & Material3  
- 🛰️ Work on BLE-based IoT apps (smart devices, appliances)  
- 📞 Develop communication apps using WebRTC and Smack (XMPP)  
- 🧩 Integrate Room DB, Coroutines, Flows, Retrofit, WorkManager  
- 🛠️ Set up CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Bitrise)  
- 🌐 RESTful API integration, backend in Node.js & Java  
- 🤖 Build AI tools using OpenAI APIs, Streamlit, and Python  
- 🧪 Unit & UI testing using JUnit, Espresso, Robolectric  

I'm always open to collaborating on:  
- Android app architecture design  
- BLE/IoT solutions  
- XMPP or WebRTC projects  
- AI-powered mobile or web tools  
- Compose-based open source apps
